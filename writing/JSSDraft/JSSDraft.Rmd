# Introduction

## Environmental time series studies and why they're important

## Using simulated time series for power analysis

## Using simulated time series to test modeling questions

## Challenges in creating simulated time series

* Not consistent across different studies
* Time consuming to create, often only need to customize certain parts

# Basic overview of package

# Implementing the package

## Simulating time series

## Using simulated time series for power analysis

## Using simulated time series to test modeling questions

## Evaluating simulations based on these time series

## Customizing simulations
